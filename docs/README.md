# AgenticRAG 

## Introduction

AgenticRAG is a comprehensive library for building flexible Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It provides a modular architecture that allows developers to customize each component according to their specific requirements while maintaining compatibility across the system.

This library solves several key challenges in building RAG applications:
- Managing diverse data types (text, tables, databases) through a unified interface
- Simplifying data ingestion from various sources
- Providing flexible retrieval mechanisms adapted to different data types
- Supporting multiple downstream tasks using retrieved context
- Enabling easy customization at any level of the stack

## Architecture Overview

The AgenticRAG system follows a modular, layered architecture where each component has specific responsibilities:

1. **Data Storage Layer**: Stores maintain structured representations of various data types
2. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Loaders and Connectors handle importing data into stores
3. **Data Retrieval Layer**: Retrievers access relevant information based on queries
4. **Task Execution Layer**: Tasks perform operations using retrieved context
5. **Orchestration Layer**: RAGAgent coordinates all components to fulfill user requests

This design follows key principles:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each component handles distinct responsibilities
- **Extensibility**: Custom implementations can be created for any component
- **Loose coupling**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
- **Progressive disclosure**: Simple use cases are easy, while complex customization is possible
