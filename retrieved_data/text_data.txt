# Story Arcs | One Piece Wiki | Fandom
The storyline of *One Piece*—[manga](/wiki/One_Piece_(Manga) "One Piece (Manga)") and [anime](/wiki/One_Piece_(Anime) "One Piece (Anime)") alike—is commonly divided into individual **story arcs** for easier understanding. While the exact divisions are somewhat fluid, it is generally understood that an arc begins when the [Straw Hat Pirates](/wiki/Straw_Hat_Pirates "Straw Hat Pirates") land on a specific island and ends when they leave.
All story arcs are grouped into larger **sagas**, which tend to reflect goals and/or enemies that the Straw Hats pursue across multiple islands.

### [The Final Sea: The New World Saga](/wiki/The_Final_Sea:_The_New_World_Saga "The Final Sea: The New World Saga")
Because the [*One Piece* manga](/wiki/One_Piece_(Manga) "One Piece (Manga)") is still ongoing, [Toei Animation](/wiki/Toei_Animation "Toei Animation") uses non-manga material ([filler](/wiki/Canon#Fillers "Canon")) as a way to slow down the progression of the plot. If the [anime](/wiki/One_Piece_(Anime) "One Piece (Anime)") were to catch up with the manga, Toei would either have to wait for [Oda](/wiki/Eiichiro_Oda "Eiichiro Oda") to release more manga chapters, take the story in a direction independent of the manga (as was done in *[Rurouni Kenshin](https://kenshin.fandom.com/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin "w:c:kenshin:Rurouni Kenshin")*, *[Elfen Lied](https://elfen-lied.fandom.com/wiki/Elfen_Lied_(Manga) "w:c:elfen-lied:Elfen Lied (Manga)")*, *[InuYasha](https://inuyasha.fandom.com/wiki/InuYasha_(series) "w:c:inuyasha:InuYasha (series)")* and *[Fullmetal Alchemist](https://fma.fandom.com/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_(manga) "w:c:fma:Fullmetal Alchemist (manga)")*), or simply end it; any of these would likely damage the popularity of the series, and would not reflect well on either Toei Animation or Oda. Thus, additional material is the only viable alternative.
Unlike non-manga material in many other shows, most *One Piece* filler takes place in story arcs independent from the main plot and having little to no effect on the subsequent [canon](/wiki/Canon "Canon") story. These arcs also generally consist of lighter fare than Oda's own work, containing much more comedy, the presence of child characters, and little in the way of drama. Currently, the anime has sixteen story arcs not present in the manga:
