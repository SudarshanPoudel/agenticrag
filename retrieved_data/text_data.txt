# AutoGPT - Wikipedia
Background ----------
[[edit](/w/index.php?title=AutoGPT&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")]
On March 30, 2023, AutoGPT was released by Toran Bruce Richards, the founder and lead developer at video game company Significant Gravitas Ltd.[[3]](#cite_note-tsun-3) AutoGPT is an open-source autonomous AI agent based on OpenAI's API for GPT-4,[[4]](#cite_note-:1-4) the large language model released on March 14, 2023. AutoGPT is among the first examples of an application using GPT-4 to perform autonomous tasks.[[3]](#cite_note-tsun-3)
Richards developed AutoGPT to create a model that could respond to real-time feedback and to tasks that include long-term outlooks.[[5]](#cite_note-:10-5) Users are prompted to describe the AutoGPT agent's name, role, and objective and specify up to five ways to achieve that objective.[[6]](#cite_note-:0-6) From there, AutoGPT will independently work to achieve its objective without the user having to provide a prompt at every step.[[7]](#cite_note-:8-7)
In October 2023, AutoGPT raised $12M[[8]](#cite_note-8) from investors.
### Usage
[[edit](/w/index.php?title=AutoGPT&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Usage")]

AutoGPT is publicly available on GitHub.[[6]](#cite_note-:0-6) To use it, users must install AutoGPT in a development environment such as Docker. Also, users must register it with an API key from OpenAI, which requires users to have a paid OpenAI account.[[6]](#cite_note-:0-6)

### Business
AutoGPT can be used to do market research, analyze investments, research products and write product reviews, create a business plan or improve operations, and create content such as a blog or podcast.[[4]](#cite_note-:1-4) One user has used AutoGPT to conduct product research and write a summary on the best headphones.[[10]](#cite_note-:4-10) Another user has used AutoGPT to summarize recent news events and prepare an outline for a podcast.[[10]](#cite_note-:4-10)
### Other
[[edit](/w/index.php?title=AutoGPT&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Other")]

AutoGPT was used to create ChefGPT, an AI agent able to independently explore the internet to generate and save unique recipes.[[9]](#cite_note-:3-9) AutoGPT was also used to create ChaosGPT, an AI agent tasked to “destroy humanity, establish global dominance, cause chaos and destruction, control humanity through manipulation, and attain immortality”.[[11]](#cite_note-:9-11) ChaosGPT reportedly researched nuclear weapons and tweeted disparagingly about humankind.[[11]](#cite_note-:9-11)

Limitations -----------

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=AutoGPT&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Limitations")]

AutoGPT is susceptible to frequent mistakes, primarily because it relies on its own feedback, which can compound errors.[[12]](#cite_note-:5-12) In contrast, non-autonomous models can be corrected by users overseeing their outputs.[[12]](#cite_note-:5-12) Furthermore, AutoGPT has a tendency to [hallucinate](/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence) "Hallucination (artificial intelligence)") or to present false or misleading information as fact when responding.[[13]](#cite_note-13)
